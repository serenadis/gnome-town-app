You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### MY ASSUMPTIONS:

I assume that the backend API calls have this structure:
    
    getProfiles: I will get only the list of the gnomes (names and thumbnails)
    getProfileById: I will get the profile information of each gnome (name, age, weight, height, hair color, professions, 
    friends with their id, name, thumbnails)
    getProfessions: I will get all the possible professions and related icons or images
