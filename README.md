### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### MY ASSUMPTIONS:

I assume that the backend API calls have this structure:
    
    getProfiles: I will get only the list of the gnomes (names and thumbnails)
    getProfileById: I will get the profile information of each gnome (name, age, weight, height, hair color, professions, 
    friends with their id, name, thumbnails)
    getProfessions: I will get all the possible professions and related icons or images
